## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Installation

Start by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oadultradeepfield/olympliance-backend.git
cd olympliance-backend
```

Before starting the local development server, ensure that the environment variables are correctly configured. Specifically, set up the `.env` file. You can refer to [`.env.example`](/.env.example) for guidance. Below is an example of the default configuration. During development, you can set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to `*` to allow requests from any origin. In production, make sure to set `GO_ENVIRONMENT` to `production`.

```
PORT=8080
DSN=your_postgres_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://www.your-client-url.com/
GO_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

The `DSN` variable is the database connection string, which can be obtained from the service you are using for deployment. For Neon, the connection string typically follows this format:

```
postgresql://[role]:[password]@[hostname]/[database]?sslmode=require
```

### 3.2 Building and Running the App

This Go application is containerized using Docker. To simplify the setup, it is recommended to use Docker CLI tools to build the app. Please ensure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is installed. If you prefer to do local development (optional), make sure you also have Go installed.

This project uses Go version 1.23.4. You can check your installed Go version or verify if Go is installed by running the following command:

```bash
go version
```

To build and run the Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Alternatively, you can build the Docker image separately and run it later using Docker Desktop:

```bash
docker compose build
```

By default, the app will run on `PORT 8080`. To verify if the server is running correctly, visit [http://localhost:8080/health](http://localhost:8080/health). The server should return:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

## 4. Deployment

To deploy using Google Cloud Run, ensure that the `gcloud` CLI is installed on your local machine and set up for authentication. Refer to the installation guide on this [page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) for detailed instructions.

Once authenticated, you can tag the Docker image with the Artifact Registry URL on Google Cloud by running:

```bash
docker tag [LOCAL_IMAGE_NAME] [ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL]
```

Next, push the Docker image to the Artifact Registry using:

```bash
docker push [ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_IMAGE_URL]
```

After the image is pushed, navigate to Google Cloud Run in the Google Cloud Console and deploy the server using the uploaded image. You may also need to specify environment variables and secrets except for the `PORT 8080`, which is injected by the platform.

#### Tips for Staying Within the Free Tier

- Configure the server to start based on incoming requests. Note that this will introduce a _cold start_, which may slow down the initial response time.
- Adjust resource settings, such as reducing the allocated CPU, RAM, and maximum instances, to minimize server workloads. These changes may make the app slower but will help maintain an optimal balance for this applicationâ€™s needs.

**Note**: If you are using macOS devices with ARM architecture, ensure that you build the Docker image with the `linux/amd64` platform flag to guarantee compatibility with Google Cloud Run. By default, macOS devices build images using the `linux/arm64` platform, which works well for local development but may not run correctly on Google Cloud.

Below is an example of how to configure the [`docker-compose.yaml`](/docker-compose.yaml) file to specify the platform:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      platform: linux/amd64 # add this line
    image: olympliance-server:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - PORT=${PORT}
      - DSN=${DSN}
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
      - ALLOWED_ORIGINS=${ALLOWED_ORIGINS}
      - GO_ENVIRONMENT=${GO_ENVIRONMENT}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## 5. API Documentation

### 5.1 Authentication Endpoints

This app uses username-based authentication with JWT. Note that there is no JWT refresh token. As a result, the authentication is valid for 24 hours before it becomes invalid.

| **DELETE** `/api/comments/:id`                                                                             | None                                                                            | `Bearer <token>`            | Delete an existing comment (only if the user is the owner or has admin rights).                                  |

### 5.5 Interaction Endpoints

The interactions supported in this app are upvotes, downvotes, and follows (which are not available for comments). Users can interact by posting if they haven't previously interacted with the same thread or comment. If they have, the interaction will be updated or deleted.

| **URL**                                                                                     | **Body**                                                                          | **Authorization Header**    | **Meaning**                                                                                                                              |

| **GET** `/api/interactions?user_id={user_id}&thread_id={thread_id}&comment_id={comment_id}` | None                                                                              | `Bearer <token>` (optional) | Retrieves interactions based on `user_id` and optional `thread_id` or `comment_id`. Either `thread_id` or `comment_id` must be provided. |
| **POST** `/api/interactions`                                                                | `{ "thread_id": "number", "comment_id": "number", "interaction_type": "string" }` | `Bearer <token>`            | Creates a new interaction of type `upvote`, `downvote`, or `follow` for a thread or comment.                                             |
| **PUT** `/api/interactions/:id`                                                             | `{ "interaction_type": "string" }`                                                | `Bearer <token>`            | Updates an existing interaction identified by `id` to a new type of interaction.                                                         |

### Extra: User Reputation Calculator

In addition to the API, this app includes a user reputation calculator service that runs when the server starts. The reputation score for each thread or comment a user makes is calculated using the formula: `max(0, upvotes - downvotes) + comments + follows`. The logic for assigning badges and ranks is handled on the frontend.
